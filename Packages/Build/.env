# set the environment variable 'ENV' to either:
# 'dev'        =>  code will be bundled without minification & tree-shaking; fastest build time; default behavior.
# 'prod'       =>  code will be concatenated, mangled & tree-shaked; slowest build time; not recommended for daily work.
# 'dev-srcmap' =>  code will be treated like in 'dev' but with src-maps.
# 'dev-debug'  =>  code will be treated like in 'dev' but, additionally, size stats will be collected and
#                  then viewed with a local dev server; ATTENTION: if task will be terminated, the server stops too.
# 'prod-debug' =>  code will be treated like in 'dev-debug' but with 'prod' context.
# 'prod-debug-min' =>  code will be treated like in 'prod-debug' but completely minified.
ENV=dev
